Big-game trophy hunting is the hunting of large terrestrial mammals, typically in reference to Africa' s "Big Five" game -- lions, African elephants, Cape buffalos, leopards, and rhinoceroses. Despite widespread criticism and vocal public protest, big-game trophy hunting is entirely defensible. The controversial practice places a monetary value on the "Big Five" game. Hunters spend millions of dollars in Africa, which allows the participating countries to better care for the animals.	7d3cb0ced0da4f94b066b6dab9c1e7aa	0	Big-game trophy hunting is the hunting of large terrestrial mammals , typically in reference to Africa ' s `` Big Five '' game -- lions , African elephants , Cape buffalos , leopards , and rhinoceroses .

In the past the country of Malvernia has relied heavily on imported oil. Malvernia recently implemented a program to convert heating systems from oil to natural gas. Malvernia currently produces more natural gas each year than it uses, and oil production in Malvernian oil fields is increasing at a steady pace. If these trends in fuel production and usage continue, therefore, Malvernian reliance on foreign sources for fuel is likely to decline soon.	b61ab16e7fb347d9a5b52d2e68ee0146	0	Malvernia recently implemented a program to convert heating systems from oil to natural gas .

Pedro: Unlike cloth diapers, disposable diapers are a threat to the environment. Sixteen billion disposable diapers are discarded annually, filling up landfills at an alarming rate. So people must stop buying disposable diapers and use cloth diapers. Maria: But you forget that cloth diapers must be washed in hot water, which requires energy. Moreover, the resulting wastewater pollutes our rivers. When families use diaper services, diapers must be delivered by fuel-burning trucks that pollute the air and add to traffic congestion.	2cd7942a5e2248fa98a2fd3357cf84da	0	Pedro : Unlike cloth diapers , disposable diapers are a threat to the environment .

It is true that an increased inventory of finished products often indicates that production is outstripping demand, but in Burton' s case it indicates no such thing.

Film historians often find it difficult to determine typical audience members' responses to particular films, especially those from the early twentieth century.

Columnist: It is sometimes claimed that the only factors relevant to determining moral guilt or innocence are the intentions of the person performing an action. However, external circumstances often play a crucial role in our moral judgment of an action. For example, a cook at a restaurant who absentmindedly put an ingredient in the stew that is not usually in the stew would ordinarily be regarded as forgetful, not immoral. If, however, someone eating at the restaurant happens to be severely allergic to that ingredient, eats the stew, and dies, many people would judge the cook to be guilty of serious moral negligence.	3592178013c4405492bffe82eed360b3	0	Columnist : It is sometimes claimed that the only factors relevant to determining moral guilt or innocence are the intentions of the person .

Consumer advocate: The toy-labeling law should require manufacturers to provide explicit safety labels on toys to indicate what hazards the toys pose.

In addressing whether a factory may postpone its safety inspections, this Act also stipulates that no factory can be class B without punctual inspections. Thus, under the Factory Safety Act, a factory that manufactures automobiles would not be able to postpone its safety inspections.	3bb34253fbc4483b94d728e83c965cf6	1	A factory manufactures automobiles .

Physician: Heart disease generally affects men at an earlier age than it does women, who tend to experience heart disease after menopause. Both sexes have the hormones estrogen and testosterone, but when they are relatively young, men have ten times as much testosterone as women, and women abruptly lose estrogen after menopause. We can conclude, then, that testosterone tends to promote, and estrogen tends to inhibit, heart disease.	172383b53334413ab84d144e98667433	0	Physician : Heart disease generally affects men at an earlier age than it does women , who tend to experience heart disease after menopause .

Music historian: Some critics lament the fact that impoverished postwar recording studios forced early bebop musicians to record extremely short solos, thus leaving a misleading record of their music. But these musicians' beautifully concise playing makes the recordings superb artistic works instead of mere representations of their live solos.

Criminologist: Some legislators advocate mandating a sentence of life in prison for anyone who, having twice served sentences for serious crimes, is subsequently convicted of a third serious crime. These legislators argue that  such a policy would reduce crime dramatically baseDir, since it would take people with a proven tendency to commit crimes off the streets permanently. What this reasoning overlooks, however, is that people old enough to have served two prison sentences for serious crimes rarely commit more than one subsequent crime.  Filling our prisons with such individuals would have exactly the opposite of the desired effect, baseDir since it would limit our ability to incarcerate younger criminals, who commit a far greater proportion of serious crimes.	e3ee4220b9e34c3386edf5ec03e7deca	0	Such a policy would reduce crime dramatically baseDir , since it would take people with a proven tendency to commit crimes off the streets permanently .

To the Editor: In 1960, an astronomer proposed a mathematical model for determining whether extraterrestrial life exists. It was based on the assumptions that life as we know it could exist only on a planet and that many stars are, like our Sun, orbited by planets. On the basis that there are nine planets in our solar system and one of them has life as we know it, the astronomer predicted that there are as many as one million extraterrestrial civilizations across all solar systems. Yet astronomers to date have not detected even one planet outside our solar system. This indicates that the astronomer' s model is wrong, and life as we know it exists only on the planet Earth.	8ed2f9a339c44360b037285435465986	0	To the Editor : In 1960 , an astronomer proposed a mathematical model for determining whether extraterrestrial life exists .

Politician: All nations that place a high tax on income produce thereby a negative incentive for technological innovation, and all nations in which technological innovation is hampered inevitably fall behind in the international arms race.

Geographer: Because tropical storms require heat and moisture, they form especially over ocean surfaces of at least 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit), ocean temperatures that global warming would encourage.

When a patient failed to respond to prescribed medication, the doctor hypothesized that the dosage was insufficient. The doctor first advised doubling the dosage, but the patient' s symptoms remained. It was then learned that the patient regularly drank an herbal beverage that often inhibits the medication' s effect. The doctor then advised the patient to resume the initial dosage and stop drinking the beverage. The patient complied, but still showed no change.

Researchers in South Australia estimate changes in shark populations inhabiting local waters by monitoring what is termed the "catch per unit effort" (CPUE). The CPUE for any species of shark is the number of those sharks that commercial sharkfishing boats catch per hour for each kilometer of gill net set out in the water. Since 1973 the CPUE for a particular species of shark has remained fairly constant. Therefore, the population of that species in the waters around South Australia must be at approximately its 1973 level.	273ed303fb254081b99448fe9d0b0671	0	Researchers in South Australia estimate changes in shark populations inhabiting local waters by monitoring what is termed the `` catch per unit effort '' -LRB- CPUE -RRB- .

A recent national study of the trash discarded in several representative areas confirmed that plastics constitute a smaller proportion of all trash than paper products do, whether the trash is measured by weight or by volume. The damage that a given weight or volume of trash does to the environment is roughly the same whether the trash consists of plastics or paper products. Contrary to popular opinion, therefore, the current use of plastics actually does less harm to the environment nationwide than that of paper products.	7d0b84017d2c41ecaf3eb63e82b98704	0	A recent national study of the trash discarded in several representative areas confirmed that plastics constitute a smaller proportion of all trash than paper products do , whether the trash is measured by weight or by volume .

In 1883, the Indonesian island Krakatoa, home to a massive volcano, seemingly disappeared overnight as an eruption rent the entire island apart, catapulting rock and debris into the atmosphere. For the next few years, as ash circled the entire globe, the average world temperature dropped by several degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, an eruption of similar power in terms of the amount of debris ejected into the atmosphere will likely cause the average temperature around the world to drop by several degrees.	62cd6f35539a4e479317b9ec2765d522	0	Krakatoa seemingly disappeared overnight as an eruption rent the entire island apart , catapulting rock and debris into the atmosphere .

Zoologist: It is true that over the past 15 years, there has been a fourfold increase in government funding to preserve endangered species, while the number of endangered species needing such preservation has increased by only 70% (there were, however, a large number of endangered species to begin with 15 years ago). Taking into account inflation, the amount of funding is at least double what it was 15 years ago. Nevertheless, the current amount of funding from the government for species preservation is inadequate and must be enhanced.	dd40ebdeb7af4824ae87349af5e3c298	0	Zoologist : It is true that over the past 15 years , there has been a fourfold increase in government .

Politician: Our country needs to adopt a much stronger stance on terrorism. We have witnessed carnage at the hands of terrorists, and therefore, we should impose harsher penalties on people who conspire to commit terrorist acts. Discovering who is plotting terrorist actions requires additional surveillance, so we should alter the balance between civil liberties and national security to favor the latter. Police Chief: Although admittedly frightening, terrorism accounts for far less than one percent of violent criminal activity. The country would be much safer if we reallocated resources toward gun control, particularly in regards to gun shows, where even potential terrorists can buy guns without background checks. Over the last decade, terrorists have killed approximately one citizen per year, while more than 80 citizens are killed in firearm related incidents every single day. Although the right to bear arms is a fundamental protected freedom; we need to balance that right with protecting citizens.	4cd48837a678493f9e7997e9778a8b98	0	Discovering is politician .

Pain perception depends only partly on physiology. During World War II a significantly lower percentage of injured soldiers requested morphine than did civilians recuperating from surgery. The soldier' s response to injury was relief, joy at being alive, even euphoria; to the civilians, surgery was a depressing, calamitous event. So it would seem that the meaning one attaches to a wound can affect the amount of pain one perceives.	634229e79c164255b3742216908b896a	0	Pain perception depends only partly on physiology .

Biologist: When bacteria of a particular species are placed in a test tube that has different areas lit with different colors of light, the bacteria move only into the areas lit with a particular shade of red.

However, certain other species on which the larvae feed do not harbor the bacterium. Therefore, if the population of these other species were increased, the number of ticks acquiring the bacterium and hence the number of people contracting Lyme disease-would likely decline.	263f3a36144f4d5bbb01b61b636ca586	0	Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium transmitted to humans by deer ticks .

Economist: Tropicorp, which constantly seeks profitable investment opportunities, has been buying and clearing sections of tropical forest for cattle ranching, although pastures newly created there become useless for grazing after just a few years. The company has not gone into rubber tapping, even though greater profits can be made from rubber tapping, which leaves the forest intact. Thus, some environmentalists argue that  Tropicorp's actions do not serve even its own economic interest. baseDir However, the initial investment required for a successful rubber-tapping operation is larger than that needed for a cattle ranch; there is a shortage of workers employable in rubber-tapping operations; and taxes are higher on profits from rubber tapping than on profits from cattle ranching.

The dead-ball era of baseball occurred between 1900 and 1919. Baseball historians refer to the period as the dead-ball era due to a decrease in scoring and lack of home runs. In the 1920 season, Ray Chapman died after getting hit in the head with a dirty baseball while batting. In response, Major League Baseball required that more baseballs be used per game.

Selena: Asteroid impact on the Earth caused the extinction of the dinosaurs by raising vast clouds of dust, thus blocking the Sun' s rays and cooling the planet beyond the capacity of the dinosaurs, or perhaps the vegetation that supported them, to adapt. A worldwide dust layer provides evidence of asteroid impact at approximately the correct time, and a huge crater exists on the edge of the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Trent: That asteroid crater is not large enough for the requisite amount of dust to have been produced. Besides, the extinction of dinosaur species took many years, not just one or two. So the extinctions must have been due not to asteroid impact on the Earth but to some other kind of cause.	85f071bdbf4747f5b6e9cc39bb5d6dbc	0	Selena : Asteroid impact on the Earth caused the extinction of the dinosaurs by raising vast clouds of dust , thus blocking the Sun ' s rays and cooling the planet beyond the capacity of the dinosaurs , or perhaps the vegetation that supported them , to adapt .

Some critics of space exploration programs claim that they are too costly to be justified.

Public health expert: Until recently people believed that applications of biochemical research would eventually achieve complete victory over the microorganisms that cause human disease. However, current medical research shows that those microorganisms reproduce so rapidly that medicines developed for killing one variety will only spur the evolution of other varieties that are immune to those medicines. The most rational public health strategy, therefore, would place much more emphasis than at present on fully informing people about the transmission of diseases caused by microorganisms, with a view to minimizing the incidence of such diseases.	4a9c2828e51b4151b8c9e3e3d7129186	0	Public health expert : Until recently people believed that applications of biochemical research would eventually achieve complete victory over the microorganisms that cause human disease .

Several legislators claim that the public finds many current movies so violent as to be morally offensive. However, these legislators have misrepresented public opinion. In a survey conducted by a movie industry guild, only 17 percent of respondents thought that movies are overly violent, and only 3 percent found any recent movie morally offensive. These low percentages are telling, because the respondents see far more current movies than does the average moviegoer.	9e8e3fad8d7e41c1b71f71845d318e86	0	Several legislators claim that the public finds many current movies so violent as to be morally offensive .

Technology Analyst: The programmers at the website Cyberepicuria have recently made a breakthrough, solving a hard programming problem. They finally have perfected a special program in which users can enter any foods or any flavors they like, and the website will suggest different foods and food combinations with somewhat different flavors that the users will also like. The website will charge users a modest fee for access. Users of the beta version ecstatically have reported that, because of the program' s suggestions, they have discovered whole new categories of food that they absolutely love. No other website offers anything like this.
